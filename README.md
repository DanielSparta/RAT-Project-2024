### Ultimate SpartaRAT C# Project
# Info
This RAT project made for fun, I work on updates often.
I started with this project because I had so many ideas, with code I can be creative. This project is still under work, I will add alot more features.
I update this project very often.

**I will greatly appreciate all those who could invest their time in PR (Pull Request) or CR (Code Review) my project.**

# Why SpartaRAT is better than the others?
- Anti Virus bypass - True for today there is no anti virus that detects my program
- ESP32 Real life boards support - You can do really cool things
- Persistence (using task scheduler - with powershell obfuscations and c# logical code the anti virus not say anything)
- .NET Framework - tested at the latest windows 11, 10, 8.1 versions
- Open source & Easy to contact the developer
- Really well written code, easy and fun to read, learn, or debugging
- Home made code - I am the one who write almost all the code, not ChatGPT or forums
- Very soon NAT Hole punching support feature

  **Alot more stuff will be added soon.**

**_Alot More Features Soon_**
**_I would really appreciate any CR or ideas_**

## ESP32-Cam Requirements
- You must compile the code into the esp32 cam by yourself
- Atleast Arduino IDE 1.x or any other compiler
- install board - Arduino AVR Boards (by Arduino)
- install board - ESP32 board (by Espressif Systems)
- Choosing Board - AI Thinker ESP32-CAM
- Choosing the right USB port
- Making sure the RAT and the ESP32-Cam are connected to the same WIFI

**_Then, Compile._**


## Fun fact
- I presented this project as a final project of an electronics major
